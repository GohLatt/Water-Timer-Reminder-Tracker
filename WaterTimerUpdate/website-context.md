## h2 How to drink

### h3 Sit down while drinking water

Standing and drinking disrupts the balance of body fluids. You may accumulate unwanted excess fluid in your body if you drink while standing up which can often lead to arthritis.

### h3 Drink slowly

Drinking water in small sips allows the body to process the nutrients and minerals well. It also makes it easier for our kidneys to process all the fluids.

### h3 Start your day with a glass of boiled water

Drink warm water in the morning as it helps flush out the toxins that have accumulated overnight and cleanses your digestive tract to get you ready for the day! It also increases your metabolism
